# MurimGAN: Generating Unique Anime Characters Inspired by Cultivation and Murim Themes

## Overview
MurimGAN is a project aimed at generating unique anime characters inspired by cultivation and Murim themes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is built on **StyleGAN**, a state-of-the-art architecture for generating high-quality, realistic images. This project explores the fusion of traditional anime aesthetics with the powerful generative capabilities of GANs to create dynamic, visually stunning characters.

## Key Features
- **Cultivation & Murim-Inspired Designs**: Generates anime characters with visual elements drawn from cultivation and Murim (martial arts) stories.
- **StyleGAN Architecture**: Utilizes StyleGAN to generate high-quality, diverse character designs.
- **Custom Dataset**: A curated dataset focused on cultivation and Murim-inspired anime aesthetics.
- **Interactive and Customizable**: The generated characters can be adjusted based on certain traits (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, powers).
